# Tech Quiz Test Suite
This project implements a full testing suite for a MERN-based Tech Quiz application using Cypress. The goal of this challenge was to demonstrate the ability to write both component and end-to-end tests, ensuring the application behaves as expected under real-world conditions.

## Description

This Tech Quiz application allows users to take a quiz of 10 random questions, answer them one by one, and see their final score. The app is built using the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB** for storing questions
- **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the API
- **React** for the front end
